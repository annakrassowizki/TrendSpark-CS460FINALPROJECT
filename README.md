# TrendSpark-CS460FINALPROJECT:
A real-time heuristic algorithm to predict social media post virality based on early engagement data.
------------
## Project Summary:
This project was developed for the CS460 Final Project. It simulates early post engagement using mock Reddit data to evaluate the algorithm's accuracy and efficiency. Three non-trivial test cases were used for early validation.
-------------
##  Requirements:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- No external dependencies (standard library only)
-------------
## How to run:
- Run the algorithm on mock data:
python main.py
